**TL;DR â€“ Check out the new [Insomnia Plugin Hub](/plugins)!** ðŸ”¥

Insomnia is a great tool for interacting with GraphQL and REST APIs. But, did you know that 
it can be extended even further with plugins? The community has made some amazing plugins since
the plugin system's initial launch two years ago, from custom 
themes like the [Material Darker](/plugins/insomnia-plugin-material-darker-hc-theme/), to 
HTTP signature generation with 
[Better HTTP Signatures](/plugins/insomnia-plugin-better-http-signatures/), to an XDebug UI
switch with [XDebug](/plugins/insomnia-plugin-xdebug). It's amazing to see the community using
plugin to help make Insomnia even more useful.

Because of this, we are happy to announce the [Insomnia Plugin Hub](/plugins). Our goal with the plugin hub 
is to make it easier for the community to discover plugins, provide a space for plugin creators to 
showcase their work, and increase usage of plugins overall. The current plugin ecosystem 
is great and this is our first major investment to make it even better.

Here's a quick look at what it looks like.

## Browse and Search Plugins

Search for a specific plugin, or browse them all from the main page.

## Plugin Pages

Each plugin gets itâ€™s own dedicated page on the siteâ€”readme displayed in full.

## One Click Install

One of the biggest features, and most amazing in my opinion, is the ability to install a plugin 
directly from the site. No more having to copy the plugin-name and manually installing.

__*All colorschemes are now free as of Insomnia 6.0*__ &#128079;

It's now been over two years since I left my _real job_ to work on Insomnia full-time 🙌. Today, Insomnia 
remains a single-person company – just as it began – but app development is now assisted by a growing community 
of [30+ open-source contributors](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/graphs/contributors). 
I'm still amazed at the overwhelming positivity and support I see almost every day! 💕

As shown on the [Transparency Page](/open), growth isn't slowing down. Annual recurring revenue 
recently passed **$100,000** and continues to climb 📈. Not only is this an impressive number but it also marks a
significant point in time: **Insomnia is now sustainable**! This means that growth no longer has to be the
number one priority.

Now that growth is less of a priority, it's time to start giving back. As of version 6.0, 
**premium themes will no longer require a paid subscription**! 🎉 And, as Insomnia continues to grow, 
I hope to be able to give back to this community even more. 

Thanks so much to the 600+ people who have signed up for a paid plan, to everyone who's contributed to the
project, and to the hundreds of thousands of people who have used Insomnia over it's lifetime. It 
wouldn't be without you. Seriously, thanks. 😍💕
